## Whether you are struggling with pain and discomfort, seeking to reduce the stresses of life, interested in prevention and wellness, or have a more specific need, a massage therapy program can provide you with many options.

Massage is one of the oldest healing arts:

Chinese records dating back 3,000 years document its use; the ancient Hindus, Persians and Egyptians applied forms of massage for many ailments; and Hippocrates wrote papers recommending the use of rubbing and friction for joint and circulatory problems. Today, the benefits of massage are varied and far-reaching. As an accepted part of many physical rehabilitation programs, massage therapy has also proven beneficial for many chronic conditions, including low back pain, arthritis, bursitis, fatigue, high blood pressure, diabetes, immunity suppression, infertility, smoking cessation, depression, and more. And, as many millions will attest, massage also helps relieve the stress and tension of everyday living that can lead to disease and illness.

There are various styles of massage each having their own unique techniques, principles and approaches. Our goal as therapists is to help address your needs by utilizing the most effective hands-on therapy indicated for your situation.
